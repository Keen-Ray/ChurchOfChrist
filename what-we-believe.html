                <blockquote>
                        “Then he [the Philippian jailer] called for a light, ran in, and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas.   And he brought them out and said, ‘Sirs, what must I do to be saved?’ So they said, ‘Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.’ Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house. And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes. And immediately he and all his family were baptized. Now when he had brought them into his house, he set food before them; and he rejoiced, having believed in God with all his household.” - Acts 16:29-34

                <h2>The Lord's Supper</h2>
                <p>
                    On our trip out to Oregon a few years ago, I sat next to a young man who was flying back from his brother’s funeral.  His name was Jonah.  His brother had drunk himself to death.  Jonah is a Jehovah’s Witness.  We talked quite a bit during the flight.  I was trying to think about how I could tell him some truth.  I remembered my father in law told me about an old lady who started with the Lord’s Supper with the Jehovah Witnesses.  I knew from a previous conversation with a Jehovah Witness that only those of the 144,000  (Revelation 7 and 14) who remain on the earth eat the Lord’s Supper.  The bread and the wine are passed, but no one eats it except if they are one of the 144.000.  So I asked him why only the 144.000 eat the Lord’s Supper.  He told me about the 144,000, but he had no answer as to why they were the only ones.

She wrote, “…the scenes of the long-continued conflict between good and evil have been opened to the writer of these pages.  From time to time I have been permitted to behold the working, in different ages, ofthe great controversy…” (p. 12).   And on p. 13:  “As the Spirit of God has opened to my mind the great truths of His word, and the scenes of the past <strong>and the future</strong>, I have been bidden to make known to others that which has thus been revealed--to trace the history of the controversy in past ages, and especially so to present it as to shed a light on the fast-approaching struggle of the future.” [emphasis mine]

                    There are many different Churches in today’s world some say they are right and everyone else is wrong, others say all paths lead to the same destination. How can we choose the right church? Who are really Christians? Why does it matter to me? Let’s explore these common and hard questions.

                    We can put three qualifiers on your church section that will narrow your choices down to a few biblical churches.
