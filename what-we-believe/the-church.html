                    How Do I Know Which Church Is Right?
                </h1>
                <p><small><em>by Keenan Rhea</em></small></p>
                <p>
                    There are many different Churches in today’s world; some say that they are right and everyone else is wrong, others say that all paths lead to the same destination. How can we choose the right Church? Who are really Christians? Why does it matter to me? Let us explore these common and hard questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can put three qualifiers on your Church selection that will narrow your choices down to a few biblical Churches.
                </p>
                <ol class="indented-list">
                    <li>By whom was the Church started?</li>
                    <li>Is the Church’s name biblical?</li>
                    <li>Does the Church find truth in the right place?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    First, by whom was the Church started? Jesus said in Matthew 16:18 that He came to build His Church. Paul, in I Corinthians 3:11, said that no man can lay a foundation other than Jesus Christ. If the church claims any other founder than Jesus Christ, it is not Jesus’ Church. Examples of Churches this method of dissemination would eliminate are the Lutheran Church and the Anglican Church.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second, is the church’s name biblical? A Church’s name can tell you a lot. The Church is the bride of Christ and should take his name as well. She should certainly not take the name of another man or a method. Some examples of Biblical names are Church of God (Galatians 1:13) Church Of Christ (Romans 16:16), Church at <location> (Acts 13:1, I Corinthians 1:2). In this fashion, Churches like the Baptists and Presbyterians are eliminated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Third, and most importantly: Does the Church find <i>truth</i> in the right place? If any Church gets its doctrines from places other than the Bible it is not the true Church (2 Corinthians 11:2, Revelation 22:18). Church councils, The Book of Mormon, The writing of Ellen G. White, Church documents, Church votes, the Pope, and all the other false sources of "truth" should not be trusted. Teachings should only be trusted if they are based on solid Biblical truths (2 Timothy 3:16, 2 Peter 1:20-21). How and from where a Church claims to find truth actually excludes the Catholic Church, Jehovah's Witnesses, the Mormon Church, and many others from that which the Bible concludes to be a legitimate Church.

                <p>
                    I hope this article has been of use to you. These principles should lead you to a Church that preaches and teaches the truth and will help nurture and encourage you into a more mature Christian. Make sure the Church in question claims and has Jesus as its founder, has a name that shows its Christian nature, and uses the Bible as its ultimate authority on all issues.
