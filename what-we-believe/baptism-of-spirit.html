                        And when the day of Pentecost was now come, they were all together in one place. And suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. And there appeared unto them tongues parting asunder, like as of fire; and it sat upon each one of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.

                <p>
                    <strong>According to Acts 1:4-5, this event is called the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</strong> To whom was this promised? Who were baptized in the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost? A great many people assume that the one hundred twenty disciples mentioned in Acts 1:15 were the recipients of the baptism in the Holy Spirit that is described in Acts 2:1-4.A careful study of the Scriptures leads us to believe that only the APOSTLES received it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consider with us the PROMISE of the baptism in the Holy Spirit, the FULFILLMENT of that promise, and the PURPOSE of the baptism in the Holy Spirit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    FIRST, it is essential for the sincere Bible student to read the text. We shall quote it from the American Standard Version (1901) with important words <strong>highlighted</strong> to help follow the sequence of the narrative:
                </p>
                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                    The former treatise [<small>the Gospel of Luke</small>] I made, O Theophilus, concerning all that Jesus began both to do and to teach, <small>2</small> until the day in which he was received up, after that he had given commandment [<small>see Matthew 28:19-20 and Mark 16:15-16</small>] through the Holy Spirit unto <strong>the apostles</strong> whom he had chosen: <small>3</small> <strong>to whom</strong> he also showed himself alive after his passion by many proofs, appearing <strong>unto them</strong> by the space of forty days, and speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God; <small>4</small> and, being assembled together <strong>with them</strong>, he charged <strong>them</strong> not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, "which," said he, "<strong>ye</strong> heard from me [<small>see John 14:25-26; 15:26-27; 16:7-15, and compare Luke 24:45-49</small>]: <small>5</small> for John indeed baptized with water; but <strong>ye</strong> shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days hence. . . . . . <small>26</small> And they gave lots for them; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven <strong>apostles</strong>. <small>2:1</small> And when the day of Pentecost was now come, they were all together in one place. <small>2</small> And suddenly there came from heaven a sound as of the rushing of a mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting. <small>3</small> And there appeared unto <strong>them</strong> tongues parting asunder, like as of fire; it it sat upon each one of them. <small>4</small> And <strong>they</strong> were <strong>all</strong> <u>filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues,</u> as the Spirit gave them utterance. <small>5</small> Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, from every nation under heaven. <small>6</small> And when this sound was heard, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speaking in his own language. <small>7</small> And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying, "Behold, are not <strong>all these that speak Galileans?</strong> <small>8</small> And how hear we, every man in our own language wherein we were born? <small>9</small> Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, in Judea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia, <small>10</small> in Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and sojourners from Rome, both Jews and proselytes, <small>11</small> Cretans and Arabians, we hear them speaking in our tongues the mighty works of God." <small>12</small> And they were all amazed, and were perplexed,saying one to another, "What meaneth this?" <small>13</small> But others, mocking, said, "They are filled with new wine." <small>14</small> But Peter, <strong>standing up with the eleven</strong>, lifted up his voice, and spake forth unto them, saying, "Ye men of Judea, and all ye that dwell in Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and give ear unto my words. <small>15</small> For these are not drunken, as ye suppose; seeing it but the third hour of the day; <small>16</small> but this is that which hath been spoken through the prophet Joel: . . . . ."

                <p>
                        So WHO were baptized in the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost? Again let me ask you to consider three related things as we seek the truth on this matter:
                        <ul class="list-inline"> 
                            <li class="list-inline-item">1) the PROMISE of the baptism in the Holy Spirit;</li> 
                            <li class="list-inline-item">2) the FULFILLMENT of that promise;</li> 
                            <li class="list-inline-item">3) the PURPOSE of the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                </p>
                <h2>1. THE <strong>PROMISE</strong> OF THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT.</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>A.</strong>  While we want to focus mainly on the specific promise (below under <strong>B</strong>), it is first necessary to notice the promise. John the baptizer made a promise that was more to a general audience than to a specific audience. This is recorded in Matthew 3:7-12 (see esp. v. 11), Mark 1:7-9,  Luke 3:7-17 (see esp. v. 16), and John 1:33. (We must emphasize the necessity that you turn to and carefully study these passages.)   There are two "baptisms" promised here in Matthew and Luke's accounts, one in the Holy Spirit and the other in fire.  The former would provide an awesome blessing, the latter eternal punishment. <em>Future recipients of each were represented in John's audience.</em> Not every person present was to receive the first, and not every person present was to receive the second.   Nor was every person who would not receive one "baptism" to receive the other.   (<strong>Important</strong>:  Mark and John do not mention the baptism in  fire,  and <em>significantly</em> the context of their records of John's promise do not include any mention of a <em>judgment in fire</em>.  In the other two accounts, Matthew and Mark <em>do record</em> John's mention of the baptism in fire, and the threat is given <em>in a context warning</em> of God's fiery judgment.  A consideration of the context is crucial in realizing that the prophet John was talking about two different baptisms and not just one.)  Jesus was singled out as the administrator (the doer, the performer) of both baptisms (see, e.g., Matt. 3:11).   Consider the four accounts carefully.   Did everyone present in John's audience later receive the baptism in the Holy Spirit?  Obviously not, for some then present he called a "brood of vipers" who were in danger of the wrath to come (Matt. 3:7 and Luke 3:7), and many of the Pharisees and lawyers rejected John's preaching (Luke 7:29-30).   Was everyone addressed by John to later receive the baptism in fire?   No, for among those present were future apostles Andrew and John and others who would be devout disciples and/or apostles of Jesus.   Did every person who did not receive one receive the other?   Again the answer has to be No, unless one takes the extreme (and untenable) position that receiving the baptism in the Holy Spirit is essential to salvation.   Many not in John's audience at the time of this promise would (will) receive the awful baptism in fire.  Some who possibly weren't in his audience at time would be among those to be baptized by Jesus in the Holy Spirit. Several of Jesus' apostles had been disciples of John and would likely have been present when John made his general prediction of the two baptisms (see Acts 1:21-22).
                </p>
                <p class="pl-5">
                    <strong>B.</strong> The more specific promise was made by Jesus Himself.   Made two separate times, this promise of the baptism in the Holy Spirit was given to <em>only the apostles.</em>   And, as we shall see, the promise made by John the baptizer quite likely was directed to the future apostles of Christ who were in his audience.   Let's look at the two times that our Lord gave the promise.
