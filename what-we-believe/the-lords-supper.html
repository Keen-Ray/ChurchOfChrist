                    Introduction
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On our trip out to Oregon a few years ago, I sat next to a young man who was flying back from his brother’s funeral.  His name was Jonah.  His brother had drunk himself to death.  Jonah is a Jehovah’s Witness.  We talked quite a bit during the flight.  I was trying to think about how I could tell him some truth.  I remembered my father in law told me about an old lady who started with the Lord’s Supper with the Jehovah Witnesses.  I knew from a previous conversation with a Jehovah Witness that only those of the 144,000  (Revelation 7 and 14) who remain on the earth eat the Lord’s Supper.  The bread and the wine are passed, but no one eats it except if they are one of the 144.000.  So I asked him why only the 144.000 eat the Lord’s Supper.  He told me about the 144,000, but he had no answer as to why they were the only ones. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Lord’s Supper is a very important part of our worship.  Jesus said, <em>“Unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in yourselves.”</em>
                </p>

                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                        “Then he [<small>the Philippian jailer</small>] called for a light, ran in, and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas.   And he brought them out and said, ‘Sirs, what must I do to be saved?’   So they said, ‘Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.’   Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.   And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes.   And immediately he and all his family were baptized.   Now when he had brought them into his house, he set food before them; and he rejoiced, having believed in God with all his household.”
