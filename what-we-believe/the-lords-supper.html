                    The Lord's Supper
                </h1>

                <h2>
                    Introduction
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On our trip out to Oregon a few years ago, I sat next to a young man who was flying back from his brother’s funeral. His name was Jonah. His brother had drunk himself to death. Jonah is a Jehovah’s Witness. We talked quite a bit during the flight. I was trying to think about how I could tell him some truth. I remembered my father in law told me about an old lady who started with the Lord’s Supper with the Jehovah Witnesses. I knew from a previous conversation with a Jehovah Witness that only those of the 144,000 (Revelation 7 and 14) who remain on the earth eat the Lord’s Supper. The bread and the wine are passed, but no one eats it except if they are one of the 144.000. So I asked him why only the 144.000 eat the Lord’s Supper. He told me about the 144,000, but he had no answer as to why they were the only ones. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Lord’s Supper is a very important part of our worship. Jesus said, <em>“Unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in yourselves.”</em>
                </p>

He is the Lamb of God. The real Passover Lamb. Those who didn’t partake of the Passover in the Old Testament were cut off from Israel.

In like manner also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye drink it, in remembrance of me. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord's death till he come. Wherefore whosoever shall eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup. For he that eateth and drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself, if he discern not the body. <footer class="blockquote-footer"> I Corinthians 11:23-29</footer>

                                    I must remove the leaven of sin, I Corinthians 5:6. I can’t keep on practicing sin and have the blood of Christ cleanse me of my sin. There was no leaven at the Passover. The Passover was during the week of Unleavened Bread. If you had leaven you were cut off from Israel, Exodus 12:15. We need to confess our sin so that the blood of Jesus will cleanse us, I John 1:8, 9. Confess our sin before we eat the Lord’s Supper so that we can partake in a worthy manner.

                                    I must be united with my brother. I can’t partake in a worthy manner if I don’t discern the body. The body Paul is talking about is the church. I can’t judge or discern the physical body of Christ, but I can judge or discern those in the church. If I hate my brother I can’t take the Lord’s Supper in a worthy manner. Or if I have sinned against my brother I can’t partake in a worthy manner. Matthew 5:23-24, If therefore thou art offering thy gift at the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath aught against the, leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.

                                The fruit of the vine represents Jesus blood. Juice is pure and Jesus’ blood is pure. Wine does not represent his blood. Wine has leaven in it. You cannot make wine without yeast. Leaven as we have seen in I Corinthians 5:7 is a symbol of sin.

                                The juice also represents the new covenant. The new covenant is one that we have sin removed. We are cleansed. Not full of the leaven of sin.

                                In many churches today. Children are introduced to wine. They get their first taste of alcohol at church. The pastor says, “Drink wine.” The priest says, “Drink wine.” How evil is that?

                                        In Jeremiah 35 we have the story of Jeremiah and the Rechabites. God told Jeremiah to bring the Rechabites into the temple and pour cups of wine for them. He did this and said to them <em>“Drink wine.”</em>

                            When Jesus instituted the Lord’s Supper he didn’t tell his apostles how often or when. The first day of the week meant nothing to them. They were Jews who kept the Sabbath, the seventh day.

                                Sunday is the day we worship. We are no longer under the Old Law, Hebrews 8:7-13, Hebrews 9:15-16, and Hebrews 10:9. Keeping the Sabbath is a part of the Old Law.
                            </li>

                                We worship on Sunday because it is the day Jesus resurrected.

                                    Why did God pick the first day of the week? Jesus is to have first place in everything, Colossians 1:13-18. The first day of the week is the only day that would fit for honoring Jesus Christ. The bible makes it very clear that the Sabbath day is the last day of the week. Jesus is honored the first day of the week. Jesus met with his apostles on the first day of the week.

                                        The day of Pentecost was 50 days after the Sabbath during the Passover. Leviticus 23:15 and 16. If I start with Sunday and have 7 Sabbaths and end the day after the seventh Sabbath, I have a total of 50 days. Pentecost means fifty. Jesus was crucified on Friday during the Feast of unleavened bread. The Jews wanted him off the cross because it was the day before the Sabbath. Also this Sabbath was a high day, John 19:31, not only was this a Sabbath Day but it was the Sabbath during the days of unleavened bread. The day they were to count from.

                                Acts 20:6 and 7, Paul was in Troas for 7 days, but the 1st day of the week is when they met to break bread, to eat the Lord’s Supper. They didn’t do it for “Easter Sunday.” There was no such thing as Easter Sunday in Paul’s time. They didn’t do it because it was Passover week. Passover Week was over. This first day of the week was like all the other first days of the week and the purpose of their meeting was to eat the Lord’s Supper.

                                God told the Israelites to Remember the Sabbath Day to keep it holy. What Sabbath day? What Sabbath Day did God mean? He meant every Sabbath Day. Acts 20:7 says, “the first day of the week.” What first day of the week do you suppose they met to break bread? Every first day of the week. We don’t have a command to break bread every Sunday, but we do have a Holy Spirit inspired example.

                    <p>
                        The Lord’s Supper is one of the most important things in the Christian life. Without it we have no life. If we don’t take it in a worthy manner we are guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord. At the church in Corinth some were weak and sick and a number were asleep (dead). The Lord’s Supper is a serious time of our worship. We do make sure we eat it the way the Lord instructed us.
