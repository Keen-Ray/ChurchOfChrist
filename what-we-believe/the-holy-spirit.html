                    It is clear, as one starts his reading in verse 13 and concludes it at the end of the chapter, that keeping our body sexually pure is the focus of this portion of God’s word.   “The body is not for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body” (v. 13).   God raised the Lord from the dead and He will raise us from the dead (v. 14).   Paul necessarily uses the plural--”bodies”--in v. 15 to correspond in number with “members” (plural).   Otherwise in this context he employs the singular, “body.”   This body of ours is not to be joined to a prostitute (v. 16).   Some of the Corinthian believers had been involved in fornication and adultery and homosexual unions (v. 9)--one of them was dealt with in chapter  five--and the temptation to continue in this sin was strong.   7:2;  10:8;  2 Cor. 12:21.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    So the full force and focus of the Spirit’s argument, in verses 18-20, is that the Corinthian saints were to keep their body sexually pure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    “YOUR” AND “YOU” ARE PLURAL, AND “BODY” IS SINGULAR, IN VERSE NINETEEN
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    he body which is the temple of the Holy Spirit (v. 19) is the same body mentioned in verses 18 and 20.   To try to make the body in v. 19 the congregation would tear apart the context and disrupt the flow of thought.   But to this obvious fact it has been argued that “your” and “you” are plural in the Greek, and “body” is singular, and that therefore the “body” mentioned in v. 19 is the church.   Let’s examine that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Notice first that the context strongly shows that only one meaning is to be assigned to “body” in vv. 16-20.   Yes, “your” and “you” in v. 19 are plural, and “body” is singular.   But even though Paul refers to the body of each individual believer in this passage (and therefore must use the singular for body), the fact that he addressed the group required him to use the plural (“your” and “you”) when he addressed them, the assembly, about the believer’s body which must not be used for fornication.   This is the common rule throughout the Greek New Testament, as we shall show from numerous examples.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Even though a great many examples of this usage could be cited, we will give only a comparative few to illustrate this rule.   We will present the examples in parallel columns from the NKJV and the NIV, and after each will make a comment.

                    "Your” is plural because Paul addressed the whole church in Rome (1:7).   “Mortal body” is singular because the body of each Christian in Rome was to be kept free from the reign of sin.   It is the same in 1 Cor. 6:19-20:  “Your” is plural because Paul addressed the whole church in Corinth (1:2).   “Body” is singular because the body of each Christian in Corinth was to be kept free of sexual sin.

                    “Your” is plural because Paul was writing to all “the saints and faithful brethren in Christ in Colosse” (v. 2).   “Flesh” is singular because, being Gentile and not Jew in background, each man in Colosse had never been circumcised (compare Eph. 2:11).   In the same way, 1 Cor. 6:19 has “your” in the plural because Paul addressed his epistle to all in the church of God in Corinth, and “body” is singular because the body of each one was a temple of the Holy Spirit and must not be corrupted by sexual immorality.
